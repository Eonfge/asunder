Andrew's:
==================
- if there's no disk to begin with auto-refresh doesn't seem to work, need to push button
- need better icon
- Sound Juicer and Banshee rip to ogg almost twice faster, figure out why.
- Having the option to create a seperate Artist folder ('Library/Artist/Album/' instead of 'Library/Artist - Album/') would be better, maybe default.
- merge from eric's r4:
 - eject_disk()
 - prefs
 - clear_widgets()
 - refresh()
- if i eject the disk while ripping, strange things happen
- need a 'ripping done' dialog
- if dong wav-only, encoding bar jums to 100 right away
- adrian cd crashes


High Priority
==================
* Store local cache of CDDB info (include any changes the user makes)
* Need something to idicate "waiting" for CDDB


Low Priority
==================
* Submit new CDDB entries
* Add disc year to (ID3, etc) tags
* Find a cleaner way to cancel rips


Tests to run before a release
=============================
- try to run with an older config file
- update version in about box and configure.in
- update changelog
- make dist
- extract, compile, clean install and run

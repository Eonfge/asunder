Andrew's:
==================
- need better icon
- Sound Juicer and Banshee rip to ogg almost twice faster, figure out why.
- Having the option to create a seperate Artist folder ('Library/Artist/Album/' instead of 'Library/Artist - Album/') would be better, maybe default.
- if i eject the disk while ripping, strange things happen
- need a 'ripping done' dialog, even better a window showing the status of each track's rip/encode
- if dong wav-only, encoding bar jumps to 100 right away
- pref for setting cddb server?
- add ctrl+q/w shortcut
- log all output from programs so i can debug remotely


High Priority
==================
* Store local cache of CDDB info (include any changes the user makes)
* Need something to idicate "waiting" for CDDB


Low Priority
==================
* Submit new CDDB entries
* Add disc year to (ID3, etc) tags
* Find a cleaner way to cancel rips


Tests to run before a release
=============================
- try to run with an older config file
- update version in about box and configure.in
- update changelog
- make dist
- extract, compile, clean install and run

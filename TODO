Andrew's:
==================
- if there's no disk to begin with auto-refresh doesn't seem to work, need to push button
- need better icon
- Sound Juicer and Banshee rip to ogg almost twice faster, figure out why.
- Having the option to create a seperate Artist folder ('Library/Artist/Album/' instead of 'Library/Artist - Album/') would be better, maybe default.

High Priority
==================
* Store local cache of CDDB info (include any changes the user makes)
* Need something to idicate "waiting" for CDDB
* Add option to eject disc when done ripping


Low Priority
==================
* Submit new CDDB entries
* Add disc year to (ID3, etc) tags
* Find a cleaner way to cancel rips


Tests to run before a release
=============================
- try to run with an older config file
- update version in about box and configure.in
- update changelog
- make dist
- extract, compile, clean install and run

Andrew's:
==================
- if there's no disk to begin with auto-refresh doesn't seem to work, need to push button
- warnings in main.c and wrappers.c
- figure out a way to make it show more warnings
- need better icon
- node need libcddb-dev to build
- why does it put .gmo files in dist?
- check all returns from read() and write()


High Priority
==================
* Store local cache of CDDB info (include any changes the user makes)
* Need something to idicate "waiting" for CDDB
* Add option to eject disc when done ripping


Low Priority
==================
* Submit new CDDB entries
* Add disc year to (ID3, etc) tags
* Find a cleaner way to cancel rips


Tests to run before a release
=============================
- try to run with an older config file
- update version in about box and configure.in
- update changelog
- make dist
- extract, compile, clean install and run

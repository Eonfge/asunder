- need better icon
- find some way to deal with overwriting music and playlist files
- look into ID3v1/v2 tags for mp3s
- include the genre, year in the tags
- make sure can't edit artist or title to ''
- make sure artist + song name is unique
- need a cancel button in the cddb update
- Johnny Halliday - 'a la vie, a la mort' shows truncated filenames with libcddb 1.3.0 and LANG=fr_FR.UTF-8
- 'No CD is inserted. Please insert a CD into the specified CD-ROM drive or
revise the corresponding preferences.'


Low Priority
============
- Sound Juicer and Banshee rip to ogg almost twice faster, figure out why.
- option for saving different file types in different directories
- if i eject the disk while ripping, strange things happen
- log all output from programs so i can debug remotely
- when it starts in the suse vm i get 2xunknown child pid


Tests to run before a release
=============================
- try to run with an older config file
- comment out #define DEBUG
- update version in about box and configure.in
- update changelog
- update authors, packagers, translators
- cd po && make update-po
- make dist
- uninstall, extract, compile, install and run

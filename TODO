Andrew's:
==================
- if there's no disk to begin with auto-refresh doesn't seem to work, need to push button
- warnings in main.c
- need better icon
- update INSTALL file
- update README file
- node need libcddb-dev to build


High Priority
==================
* Store local cache of CDDB info (include any changes the user makes)
* Figure out i18n and .po stuff
* Need something to idicate "waiting" for CDDB
* Add option to eject disc when done ripping
* Memory leak when opening/closing the prefs dialog
* Convert to libglade-2


Low Priority
==================
* Submit new CDDB entries
* Make human-friendly new config file format
  (hopefully humans won't have to edit it, but just in case)
* Add compile-time option to support Electra Project (http://elektra.sourceforge.net/)
* Add disc year to (ID3, etc) tags
* Find a cleaner way to cancel rips

Tests to run before a release
=============================
- try to run with an older config file
- update version in about box and configure.in
- update changelog
- make dist
- extract, compile, clean install and run

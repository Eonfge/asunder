- need better icon
- look into ID3v1/v2 tags for mp3s
- make sure artist + song name is unique
- other codecs:
 - wavpack (flac-like)
 - faac (mp3-like, apple)


Low Priority
============
- Sound Juicer and Banshee rip to ogg almost twice faster, figure out why.
- option for saving different file types in different directories
- if i eject the disk while ripping, strange things happen
- log all output from programs so i can debug remotely
- make uninstall doesn't remove icon


Tests to run before a release
=============================
- try to run with an older config file
- comment out #define DEBUG
- update version in about box and configure.in
- update changelog
- update authors, packagers, translators
- update AUTHORS
- cd po && make update-po
- make dist-bzip2
- uninstall, extract, compile, install and run

Andrew's:
==================
- need better icon
- Having the option to create a seperate Artist folder ('Library/Artist/Album/' instead of 'Library/Artist - Album/') would be better, maybe default.
- look into ID3v1/v2 tags for mp3s
- include the genre, year in the tags
- show cddb progress
- http://www.softpedia.com/reviews/linux/Asunder-Review-65441.shtml
 - get rid of invalid characters
 - add error checking to filename format
  - no slashes, or parse into dirs
  - blank song names


Low Priority
==================
- Sound Juicer and Banshee rip to ogg almost twice faster, figure out why.
- option for saving different file types in different directories
- if i eject the disk while ripping, strange things happen
- log all output from programs so i can debug remotely
- when it starts in the suse vm i get 2xunknown child pid


Tests to run before a release
=============================
- try to run with an older config file
- comment out #define DEBUG
- update version in about box and configure.in
- update changelog
- update authors, packagers, translators
- cd po && make update-po
- make dist
- uninstall, extract, compile, install and run

Low Priority
============
- option for saving different file types in different directories
- if i eject the disk while ripping, strange things happen
- log all output from programs so i can debug remotely
- make uninstall doesn't remove icon
- cd-text support
- send the cd tags to freedb
- cover art
- musicbrainz support
- cd+g, mp3+g
- translate .desktop file
- everything gets checked when clicking refresh cddb
- make sure artist + song name is unique
- cddb_write()

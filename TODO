Andrew's:
==================
- save main window size in config (need a callback to update p->main_window_*)
- only do save_prefs when quitting
- make sure all mallocs have checks
- make sure all translatable strings are so marked


High Priority
==================
* Store local cache of CDDB info (include any changes the user makes)
* Figure out i18n and .po stuff
* Need something to idicate "waiting" for CDDB
* Add option to eject disc when done ripping
* Memory leak when opening/closing the prefs dialog
* Convert to libglade-2


Low Priority
==================
* Submit new CDDB entries
* Make human-friendly new config file format
  (hopefully humans won't have to edit it, but just in case)
* Add compile-time option to support Electra Project (http://elektra.sourceforge.net/)
* Add disc year to (ID3, etc) tags
* Find a cleaner way to cancel rips

Tests to run before a release
=============================
- try to run with an older config file

Andrew's:
==================
- need better icon
- Sound Juicer and Banshee rip to ogg almost twice faster, figure out why.
- Having the option to create a seperate Artist folder ('Library/Artist/Album/' instead of 'Library/Artist - Album/') would be better, maybe default.
- option for saving different file types in different directories
- if i eject the disk while ripping, strange things happen
- log all output from programs so i can debug remotely
- look into ID3v1/v2 tags for mp3s
- when it starts in the suse vm i get 2xunknown child pid
- don't allow blank song names
- include the genre, year in the tags
- show cddb progress
- disable widgets in preferences when parent unchecked

Low Priority
==================
* Submit new CDDB entries
* Find a cleaner way to cancel rips


Tests to run before a release
=============================
- try to run with an older config file
- comment out #define DEBUG
- update version in about box and configure.in
- update changelog
- update authors, packagers, translators
- cd po && make update-po
- make dist
- uninstall, extract, compile, install and run

Asunder is a graphical Audio CD ripper and encoder. You can use it to save tracks from an Audio CD as WAV, MP3, OGG, and/or FLAC.

Features
========
* Support for WAV, MP3, Ogg Vorbis, and FLAC audio files
* Uses CDDB to name and tag each track
* Can encode to multiple formats in one session
* Creates M3U playlists
* Allows for each track to be by a different artist
* Does not require a specific desktop environment

Requirements
============
* Linux
* GTK 2.4 or greater
* Libcddb 0.9.5 or greater
  http://libcddb.sourceforge.net/
* Cdparanoia
  http://www.xiph.org/paranoia/
* LAME (optional for MP3 support)
  http://lame.sourceforge.net/
* Vorbis-Tools (optional for Ogg Vorbis support)
  http://www.vorbis.com/
* FLAC (optional for FLAC support)
  http://flac.sourceforge.net/

To compile from source you may need the -dev or -devel versions of GTK and libcddb. On Ubuntu these packages are called libgtk2.0-dev and libcddb2-dev.

Compiling
=========
First install all the dependencies. LAME, Vorbis-Tools, and FLAC don't have to be installed to compile. They are only needed at runtime if you choose to encode in those formats.

Then run:

./configure

If you get errors, it's probably a missing dependency. Afterwards, run:

make

There shouldn't be any errors.

Now you can run asunder from the 'src' directory, but you probably want to install it, so:

su
[enter root password]
make install

And on something like Ubuntu that won't let you su:

sudo make install
[enter user's password]

If on any of the steps abovew you get errors, or even warnings, please do send me the output so I can fix them.

Contact
=======
I would love to hear from you, to know how you made use of Asunder, or with bug reports, or feature requests. Please use the form at http://littlesvr.ca/misc/contactandrew.php to send me email. Thanks in advance!

Bug Reports
===========
Please help me improve Asunder by sending me bug reports. The more of the following you can do, the easier it will be for me to fix:
- be able to reproduce the bug consistently
- run Asunder from a terminal window and send me the output (if any) that is printed there
- if it only happens with one image file, tell me what it is and, if it's freely available, where i can get it
- it's better to give me too much detail then too little
